[Light Theme] (https://xd.adobe.com/view/dd5d0245-b92b-4678-9d4a-48b3a6f48191-880e/)  
[Dark Theme] (https://xd.adobe.com/view/5ec235b6-c3c6-49a9-b783-1f1303deb1a8-0b91/)

The app uses a design system: Chai 

## Dependencies

The project uses [Versions Catalog](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/platforms.html#sub:version-catalog) to set up and share dependencies across the modules. The main reasons for choosing to adopt Versions Catalog are:
- Central place to define dependencies.
- Easy syntax.
- Does not compromise on build speeds as changes do not need the module to be compiled.

To add a dependency, navigate to **gradle/libs.versions.toml*** file, which has all the dependencies for the whole project. This file has the following sections:

[versions] is used to declare the version numbers that will be referenced later by plugins and libraries.
[libraries] Define the libraries that will be later accessed in our Gradle files.
[bundles] Are used to define a set of dependencies. For this, we have `compose`, `room`, `lifecycle` and `ktor` as examples.
[plugins] Used to define plugins.

You need to add your dependency version in [versions]. This is unnecessary if you are not sharing the version across different dependencies. After defining the version, add your library in the [libraries] section as:

```toml
compose-activity = "androidx.activity:activity-compose:1.5.0"
```

Moreover, if you have already defined the version in [versions], you define it as:

```toml
androidx-splashscreen = { module = "androidx.core:core-splashscreen", version.ref = "splash" }
```

**Note**:
- You can use separators such as -, _v, . that will be normalized by Gradle to . in the Catalog and allow you to create subsections.
- Define variables using **CamelCase**.\
- Check if the library can be added to any existing bundles.

## Material 3 Bottom Sheets
At the time of working on this app, Material 3 didn't have BottomSheet classes. Solution was to copy them from AOSP. They can be found in the `com/android254/presentation/common/bottomsheet` packages and have been used to do the Share feed and Fitter Bottom Sheets.
