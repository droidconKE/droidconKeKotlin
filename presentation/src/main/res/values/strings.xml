    <string name="placeholder_long_text">Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the @printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry\'s standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to @make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the @leap into electronic typesetting, @remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with @the release of @Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</string>
